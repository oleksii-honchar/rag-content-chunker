# ADR-0024: No Tracker API Changes Needed for File Update Flow

## Context

The file update flow needs to query old memory IDs, forget memories, and clear the tracker. The question was whether the existing FileMemoryTrackerService API is sufficient.

## Decision

**Use existing FileMemoryTrackerService API — no changes needed.** The existing methods cover all requirements:

- `getMemoryIds(filePath)` — query old memories before forget
- `forgetMemories(filePath, oldMemoryIds)` — per-ID removal of old entries, preserving new tracker data
- `trackMemory(filePath, memoryId, ...)` — add new memory IDs during ingest

**Rationale:**
1. Delete flow already uses this pattern successfully
2. No new use cases that existing API doesn't cover
3. Minimizes change surface

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Why rejected |
|-------------|------|------|-------------|
| Add `forgetAndClear(filePath)` | Single call | Mixes concerns, tracker shouldn't know about Mnemosyne | Separation of concerns |
| Add `getAndClear(filePath)` | Atomic operation | Atomicity not needed, two calls sufficient | Not worth the complexity |

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Minimal changes, uses proven patterns
- **Negative:** Two separate calls (get IDs, then clear)
- **Mitigation:** Clear tracker after forget — order is explicit
