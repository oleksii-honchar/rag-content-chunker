# Memory: Custom LiteLLM Gateway Superseded by Mastra llm Parameter

## Fact

The initial approach of building a custom `LiteLLMHttpClient` + `EnrichmentGatewayService` to bypass Mastra's `extractMetadata()` was superseded after source code investigation revealed Mastra supports custom LLMs via the `llm` parameter.

## Context

Two developer cycles: first built custom gateway (LiteLLMHttpClient with native fetch, AbortController timeout, JSON parsing with regex fallback, p-limit concurrency). Second cycle used Mastra's `llm` parameter with `@ai-sdk/openai` — much simpler, uses Mastra's infrastructure for prompts, response parsing, and error handling. Old code removed, new approach verified with 712 tests.

## Impact

Simpler implementation, fewer moving parts, less custom code to maintain. The custom gateway approach is documented as history but should not be considered the current pattern.
